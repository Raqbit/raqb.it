My name is Ramon and I like to create software.

My journey into programming started by writing server-side plugins for the game Minecraft in Java. This inspired me to dig deeper into the world of software development. Currently I'm focusing a lot on the web. On the frontend I like playing with javascript frameworks like Angular &amp; React and on the backend I usually work with Go or NodeJS.

I also have got a fair bit of experience with Linux system administration, including using Docker & Kubernetes.
